            Same process as chicken but you should add extra spices and chillipowder to it and curd is the main thing that gives the falvour to the biryani. Before cooking you should boil the rice, use basmathi rice for tasty.

            The process is different and the prawns will cook in minimum of thirty minutes, before two hours marinate the prawns with spices according to the taste and avoid curd. Hint, you should wash with turmaric powder and with lemon.
